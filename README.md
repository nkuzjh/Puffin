  Puffin Series: Towards Unified Multimodal 3D World Models
</h1>

**Puffin** is a series of unified multimodal models advancing toward 3D world
modeling. It starts from camera-centric spatial intelligence — understanding
and generating the world from arbitrary viewpoints and orientations — and
scales to a world model that represents worlds through three complementary
native 3D world states (**physics**, **geometry**, and **appearance**),
supporting camera-to-world understanding, camera-controllable generation, and
image-/text-to-3D world generation without external perception or
reconstruction modules. Each release lives in its own subdirectory of this
repository:

## Local CSGO Benchmark v2 integration

For the Puffin (not Puffin-World) generation-only baseline, see the
[run and migration guide](Puffin/CSGO_SEEN10.md),
[aligned experiment design](CSGO_SEEN10_PLAN.md), and
[validation record](Puffin/CSGO_SEEN10_VALIDATION.md).
The aligned profile is opt-in; legacy commands and results remain separate.
